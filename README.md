# Capture Photo Studio

Capture Photo Studio's site hopes to provide clients a space, wherever that may be, to create lasting memories and capture special moments that are, often times, missed. We hope to draw attention to the irony of constantly taking photos, but missing meaningful moments by not allowing ourselves to be present. Our dedicated team is here to ensure those special moments are captured and cherished for lifetimes. 

The site will be targeted toward people who want to book a photo shoot and keep memories safe through photography. The site will help people navigate through our services, gallery portfolio and contact us for more information.

	- Tenor Sans is the main font used throughout the site with Verdanna being the fallback font, in case there are issues with the font working correctly on different browsers. Tenor Sans offers the user a simple and clean read while drawing their attention with sharp lines.
	- Imagery is key, as this is a photographers website. The images chosen are designed to be eye-catching and show the strengths of the business' success. Modern, moody and simple.
